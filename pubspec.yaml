# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  fonts:
    - family: Ezra SIL
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/sileot.ttf

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # Notes about plugin "large_file_copy"
  # original issue: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/26465
  # large files are placed at:
  # android > app > src > main > assets
  # ios > Runner
  # Read https://pub.dev/packages/large_file_copy for setting up large files files.

  # Notes about location of font files:
  # Folder "fonts" is placed in the root directory of the project.
  # Put file "sileot.ttf" in the folder "fonts".

  # To work with flutter_tts, e.g. on Mac
  # In "android/app/src/build.gradle", set "minSdkVersion 21" or higher.

  # Troubleshooting: Migrate to AndroidX (the quickest way tested):
  # 1) Create a new project and copy all essential files from old project
  # 2) Run "flutter pub get" in terminal.
  # 3) Run "flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main" in terminal.
  # 4) Open the project with Android Studio
  # 5) Download & Install "Android 10.0 (Q)" at Menu > Tools > SDK Manager > Android SDK > SDK Platforms
  # 6) Download to install or upgrade "Android SDK Build-Tools" & "Google Play Services" at Menu > Tools > SDK Manager > Android SDK > SDK Tools
  # 7) Right click folder "android" on the project file tree and select "Flutter > Open Android module in Android Studio" on a new window.
  # 8) Update "Gradle plugin" when prompted.
  # 9) On the window opened in step (6), select menu "Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX".
  # 10) Select "Do Refactor" when usage is found.

  # Troubleshooting: plugin "large_file_copy: ^0.0.1" does not work after migration to AndroidX:
  # error message, "The Android Gradle plugin supports only Kotlin Gradle plugin version 1.3.10 and higher. The following dependencies do not satisfy the required version: project ':large_file_copy' -> org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.2.71"
  # A temporary solution: edited line 5 of the file "/Users/Eliran/Documents/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/large_file_copy-0.0.1/android/build.gradle" to:
  # ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.10'

  # Troubleshooting: missing sdk.dir or Android path for compiling plugin:
  # In individual plugin folders /Users/Eliran/Documents/flutter/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dartlang.org/flutter_tts-1.3.0/android
  # create a file "local.properties" with the following content
  # sdk.dir = /Users/Eliran/Library/Android/sdk
  # Alternatively, enter the following command in terminal:
  # export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/Eliran/Library/Android/sdk

  # Troubleshooting: Transform's input file does not exist: /Users/Eliran/AndroidStudioProjects/unique_bible_app_ultimate/build/app/intermediates/flutter/debug/libs.jar. (See https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/158753935)
  # This issue happened when running "flutter build apk", run the following to fix this issue:
  # 1) flutter clean
  # 2) flutter run --debug
  # 3) flutter run --profile
  # 4) flutter build apk
